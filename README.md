## Minimal Containers 101

This presentation is a primer on the process of building minimal Linux
containers.  These directions should be taken with a grain of salt.

As mentioned (verbally) in the presentation, these directions are not for
everyone.  While most folks involved with Linux will learn a thing or two about
the mechanisms used for containerization, these directions are for the folks
who wish to curate the content of their containers.

Within this repository you'll find the original slides in Libre Office Impress
"ODP" format.  This is the canonical presentation.  There is also a copy of the
presentation rendered into PDF for those who do not have access(?) to
Libre Office.

The video for the presentation can be found here: [TBD](#TBD)
